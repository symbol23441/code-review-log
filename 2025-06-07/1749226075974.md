Addition of new files and directories, such as `ChatGLMServiceImp.java` and `GitServiceImp.java`.\n2. Modifications to existing files, such as `Main.java`, which now includes additional imports and a new method that seems to interact with a Git repository and a ChatGLM service.\n3. Deletions of files, such as `IChatGLMService.java` and `IGitService.java`.\n4. Changes to the `pom.xml` file to include new dependencies, such as `java-jwt`, `org.eclipse.jgit`, and `slf4j-simple`.\n5. Addition of tests in `DemoTest.java`, which include methods for testing the ChatGLM service, Git interactions, and sending notifications to WeChat.\n\nThe diff also shows some refactoring, such as renaming the `Service` directory to `Git` and changes in the structure of the project.\n\nIf you're looking for a specific code review or have questions about the changes, please let me know, and I can provide more detailed feedback on the code or the changes made.","role":"assistant"}}],"created":1749226072,"id":"202506070007403e8d75a492574c28","model":"glm-4","request_id":"202506070007403e8d75a492574c28","usage":{"completion_tokens":248,"prompt_tokens":5548,"total_tokens":5796}}
